## 🏗️ IN PROGRESS: Phase 2 - Accelerate Map Creation

### Phase 2.1: Rule Templates ✅ COMPLETE
**Completed:**
1. ✅ Created rule-templates.ts with 7 pre-built templates
2. ✅ Built RuleTemplateSelector UI component
3. ✅ Integrated template selector into BusinessRuleConfig
4. ✅ Templates organized by category (labor, material, machine, time, other)

**Templates Available:**
- Shift Premium (conditional) - Day vs night shift rates
- Weekend Premium (conditional) - Saturday/Sunday overtime
- Machine Rates (lookup) - Machine-specific scrap/efficiency rates
- Material Grade Pricing (lookup) - Cost by material grade
- Premium Material Pricing (conditional) - Pricing by material prefix
- Overtime Threshold (conditional) - Overtime after 40 hours
- Department Overhead Rates (lookup) - Department-specific rates

**How It Works:**
- Users click "Use Template" button in BusinessRuleConfig
- Select from categorized list of templates
- Configure required fields (source/condition field)
- Template auto-fills with example values
- Users can edit values after applying

### Phase 2.2: Auto-Suggest Patterns ✅ COMPLETE
**Completed:**
1. ✅ Created pattern-detector.ts with intelligent analysis algorithms
2. ✅ Detects lookup patterns (low cardinality, structured values)
3. ✅ Detects conditional patterns (time, numeric thresholds)
4. ✅ Confidence scoring (high/medium/low based on pattern strength)
5. ✅ Built RuleSuggestions UI component
6. ✅ Integrated suggestions into BusinessRuleConfig

**Pattern Detection:**
- **Lookup Detection:** Identifies fields with 2-20 unique values and structured patterns (machine IDs, material codes, departments)
- **Conditional Detection:** Identifies time fields for shift rules, numeric fields for threshold rules
- **Confidence Scoring:** High (0.8+) for strong patterns, Medium (0.6-0.8) for moderate, Low (<0.6) for weak
- **Auto-generation:** Pre-fills lookup tables and conditions with example values based on detected patterns

**How It Works:**
- Analyzes sample data when field config panel opens
- Shows blue suggestion card above rule type selector
- Lists suggestions sorted by confidence (highest first)
- Click to expand and see details
- One-click apply to use suggestion
- Dismissible if user prefers manual configuration

### Phase 2.3: Copy/Paste Rules ⏳ PENDING
**To Build:**
1. Copy rule from one field
2. Paste to another field
3. Bulk apply to multiple fields

### Phase 3: Polish & Scale
**Priority Items:**
1. **Dependency Visualization** - Show field relationships
   - Graph showing which fields depend on which
   - Highlight circular dependencies
   - Show rule chain

2. **Confidence Scoring** - Profile quality metrics
   - % of required fields mapped
   - # of fields with business rules
   - Coverage % across sample data
   - Warnings count

3. **Profile Versioning** - Track changes over time
   - Save profile versions
   - Compare versions
   - Rollback capability
   - Change history

## 🎯 THE MOAT: What Makes This System Powerful

### Why This is Different
Traditional ETL tools require custom code for every data source.
**Our system:** Plant operators build reusable maps in minutes through UI.

### Real-World Example: NetSuite Integration

**Before (Traditional Approach):**
- Hire developer
- Write custom Python/SQL script
- Handle edge cases in code
- Repeat for every plant
- **Time:** 2-4 weeks per plant

**After (Our System):**
1. First plant: Human creates "NetSuite Standard" map (30 min)
2. Adds business rules for shift premiums (5 min)
3. Adds lookup table for machine rates (5 min)
4. Saves map to library
5. **Next plant:** Select map, run analysis (2 min)
6. **100th plant:** Instant, zero human intervention

### Accumulated Knowledge as Configuration
Each saved map encodes:
- ERP-specific field mappings
- Context-aware business rules
- Industry best practices
- Customer-specific overrides

**The more maps in the library, the more valuable the system becomes.**

## 🔧 TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### Frontend (Current Scope)
**Responsibility:** Map Definition UI
- Create/edit mapping profiles
- Configure business rules visually
- Preview rules against sample data
- Save configurations to database

**NOT Frontend's Job:**
- Rule execution (backend)
- Data transformation (backend)
- CSV processing at scale (backend)

### Backend (Future Integration)
**Responsibility:** Map Execution
- Load map definitions from database
- Apply business rules to full CSV data
- Execute transformations
- Validate data integrity
- Send to ML analyzers

**Flow:**
```
CSV Upload → Frontend → User Configures Map → Save to DB
                                                    ↓
Backend Loads Map → Applies Rules → Transforms Data → Analysis
```

## 📊 CURRENT CAPABILITIES

### Can Map ANY CSV:
✅ Misspelled columns (fuzzy matching in auto-suggestor)
✅ Inconsistent formats (business rules + transformations)
✅ Missing values (default values in rules)
✅ Multiple naming conventions (lookup tables normalize)
✅ Poor hygiene (data transformations clean)
✅ Mixed contexts (multiple maps per CSV)

### Business Rule Types:
✅ **Lookup Tables:** machineId → scrapRate
✅ **Conditional Overrides:** time → shift → laborRate
⏳ **Formulas:** laborHours * laborRate (coming soon)

### Data Transformations (Type System Ready, UI Pending):
⏳ Trim whitespace
⏳ Parse dates (multiple formats)
⏳ Remove units (lbs, kg, hrs)
⏳ Text normalization (uppercase/lowercase)
⏳ Find and replace

2. **The Moat:** Accumulated ERP knowledge as reusable configurations
3. **User Confidence:** Preview/validation builds trust before saving
4. **Small Files:** Easier to debug and maintain
5. **Progressive Disclosure:** Complexity hidden until needed

### Design Principles
- ✅ Small, focused files (single responsibility)
- ✅ Shadcn components only
- ✅ Mobile-friendly
- ✅ No emojis in code
- ✅ Type-safe throughout
- ✅ Progressive enhancement

## 🎉 PHASE 1 COMPLETE - Validation & Preview

**What Was Built:**
- Complete business rules type system (lookup, conditional, formula placeholder)
- Full validation engine that evaluates rules against sample data
- Visual preview system showing match statistics and coverage
- Real-time error detection with visual feedback
- Automatic Apply button disabling when validation fails
- Sample data reconstruction utility

**Impact:**
Users can now configure business rules with confidence. The system validates rules as they type, shows exactly what will happen with sample data, and prevents saving invalid configurations.

---

## 🎉 PHASE 2.1 COMPLETE - Rule Templates

**What Was Built:**
- 7 pre-built rule templates covering common manufacturing scenarios
- Template categories: labor, material, machine, time, other
- RuleTemplateSelector component with dialog UI
- Template configuration flow (select → configure → apply)
- Integration into BusinessRuleConfig with "Use Template" button

**Templates:**
1. Shift Premium - Day/night labor rate multipliers
2. Weekend Premium - Saturday/Sunday overtime rates
3. Machine Rates - Machine-specific lookup tables
4. Material Grade Pricing - Cost by material grade
5. Premium Material Pricing - Conditional pricing by prefix
6. Overtime Threshold - Overtime multiplier after 40 hours
7. Department Overhead Rates - Department-specific rates

**Impact:**
Users can now configure business rules in seconds instead of minutes. Templates encode best practices and common patterns, dramatically reducing setup time for new mapping profiles. This accelerates the "time to first map" metric and reduces errors.

**Next:** Phase 2.3 - Copy/Paste Rules (reuse rules across fields)

---

## 🎉 PHASE 2.2 COMPLETE - Auto-Suggest Patterns

**What Was Built:**
- Intelligent pattern detection engine analyzing sample data
- Lookup pattern detection (2-20 unique values, structured codes)
- Conditional pattern detection (time fields, numeric thresholds)
- Confidence scoring system (high/medium/low)
- RuleSuggestions component with expandable cards
- Auto-generation of lookup tables and conditions with example values
- One-click apply for suggestions
- Dismissible UI if manual configuration preferred

**Pattern Recognition:**
- **Machine IDs:** Detects patterns like "MACHINE-A", "MCH-01", "M-123"
- **Material Codes:** Detects patterns like "PREM-A", "STD", "MAT-001"
- **Department Codes:** Detects patterns like "PROD", "ASSY", "QC", "SHIP"
- **Time Fields:** Detects HH:MM format and suggests shift-based rules
- **Numeric Ranges:** Detects numeric fields and suggests threshold rules
- **Cardinality Analysis:** Low cardinality (2-20 values) triggers lookup suggestions

**Impact:**
The system now "understands" data patterns and proactively suggests appropriate business rules. This reduces cognitive load on users - they don't need to figure out which rule type to use, the system tells them based on the data. Confidence scoring helps users trust high-confidence suggestions while remaining cautious of low-confidence ones.

**Next:** Phase 2.3 - Copy/Paste Rules
